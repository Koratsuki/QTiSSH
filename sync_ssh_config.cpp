// Parse file from .ssh/config into a data structure that fits
//
// Subscribe to file to check for changes
//
// Update datastructure in memory whenever the user makes changes
//
// Save a copy of file whenever you write. Keep track of changes (git?) and
// allow the user to rollback
//
// Translate from that data structure to a string
// representation that will be printed to file on change

// On main thread: Make user choose if they want to keep this program's config
// in sync with .ssh/config or on a separate .local/share/QTiSSH folder. 
//
// There will be a folder that would be a perfect ~/.ssh/ folder if copied 
//
// Keep API to main and data structures well documented
